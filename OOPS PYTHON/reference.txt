1. Class methods must have an extra first parameter in the method definition. We do not give a value for this parameter when we call the method, Python provides it
2. If we have a method that takes no arguments, then we still have to have one argument â€“ the self. See fun() in the above simple example. 
3.The __init__ method 
    The __init__ method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object. 
4. In Python, instance variables are variables whose value is assigned inside a constructor or method with self
